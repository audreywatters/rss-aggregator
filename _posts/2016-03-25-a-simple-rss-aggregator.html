title: A Simple RSS Aggregator
---

<p>I am working to design, develop, and support more simple tooling that does one thing, and does it well, to show people basic examples of online tools they can put to use in their worlds.</p>
<p>Out of the work we did at the Indie Ed-Tech gathering at Davidson College in North Carolina, I wanted to provide a simple RSS aggregation tool, but rather than running in WordPress, I wanted to run it on Github.</p>
<p>This project is meant to aggregate multiple RSS feeds, into a single location, stored on Github. This project runs as a Github repository, using Github Pages, and then using the Github API, allows for writing to the repo -- effectively using it as a data storage.</p>
<p>There are two JSON stores available as part of this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indieedtech/rss-aggregator/gh-pages/_data/feed-urls.json">_data/feed-urls.json</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indieedtech/rss-aggregator/gh-pages/_data/feed-urls.json">_data/feed-urls.json</a></li>
<ul>
<p>There are three main files which make up this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://indieedtech.github.io/rss-aggregator/">List Aggregate Posts</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://indieedtech.github.io/rss-aggregator/list-urls/">List RSS Feed URLs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://indieedtech.github.io/rss-aggregator/pull-feeds/?token=[need person token]">Pull Feeds</a></li>
<ul>
<p>The pull feed function requires a Github token to run. You can get a personal token via your Github account, but have to be one of the users added to the Github project before it will work. You can fork and try in your own infrastructure, or request as part of this project.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved, or ask any questions you can submit a Github Issue, or fork the Github repository and submit a pull request. This project is meant to be a collaborative learning experience, as well as be used for aggregation of RSS.</p>
