<h3>About Project</h3>
<p>This is a project born out of the indie ed-tech discussions that occurred recently at Davidson College in North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is about exploring a simple client side RSS aggregator that runs 100% on Github, using the API, and underlying Github repo as storage.</p>
<p>While this project is functional, and you can fork and run in your repo, it is also meant to be simple, and lacking many advanced features.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/indieedtech/rss-aggregator/issues">Github Issues for this project to get support</a>.</p>
